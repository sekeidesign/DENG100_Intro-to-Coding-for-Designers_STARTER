        Welcome to "Intro to Design Engineering"
      </h1>
      <p class="text-base font-normal text-slate-500">
        Design engineering plays a critical role in web development by bringing
        a deep understanding of design details and the ability to execute on
        those details while staying agile. Design engineers work to create
        visually appealing and functional web pages that meet the needs of both
        the users and the business. They use a variety of tools and approaches
        to style content, including inline styles, CSS, and utility frameworks
        like TailwindCSS. By thinking in terms of design and development, design
        engineers can unlock the power of their design tools and create
        beautiful, effective web pages.
