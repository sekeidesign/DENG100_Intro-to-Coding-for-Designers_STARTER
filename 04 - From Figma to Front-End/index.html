    <h1>Welcome to “Intro to Design Engineering”</h1>
    <p>
      Design engineering plays a critical role in web development by bringing a
      deep understanding of design details and the ability to execute on those
      details while staying agile. Design engineers work to create visually
      appealing and functional web pages that meet the needs of both the users
      and the business. They use a variety of tools and approaches to style
      content, including inline styles, CSS, and utility frameworks like
      TailwindCSS. By thinking in terms of design and development, design
      engineers can unlock the power of their design tools and create beautiful,
      effective web pages.
